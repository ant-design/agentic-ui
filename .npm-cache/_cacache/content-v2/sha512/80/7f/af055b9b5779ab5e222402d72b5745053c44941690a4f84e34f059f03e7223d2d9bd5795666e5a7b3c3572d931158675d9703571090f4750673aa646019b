Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2.  Conveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n\n3.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version.

If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n","license":"SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE","_id":"codesandbox-import-utils@1.3.6","dist":{"shasum":"f962bf6c699ded52298405ae6c3d83077d49adc7","integrity":"sha512-mb/kxLy7Ouhny/SxhrF/JExRnNwO3w2cabSgjrpkQOU+l9p6XUlFNyRi/G9oXSjxooZvGGcSCNyoaSq7uNV+jA==","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/codesandbox-import-utils/-/codesandbox-import-utils-1.3.6.tgz","fileCount":32,"unpackedSize":42599,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nUcre\r\n=Jszn\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIDWRxm0xYE3Un0V+JmINn4QJd/YRWRSFH3SMNund243WAiEAqN1CCAHwzylwUw5yTTaRlju1bG6QtJ+Oo/xxWkj26tI="}]},"maintainers":[{"name":"compuives","email":"ives.v.h@gmail.com"}],"_npmUser":{"name":"compuives","email":"ives.v.h@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/codesandbox-import-utils_1.3.6_1542638302678_0.7462277786800553"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"1.3.7":{"name":"codesandbox-import-utils","version":"1.3.7","main":"lib/index.js","scripts":{"build":"rimraf lib && tsc -p tsconfig.json","test":"jest","test:watch":"jest --watch","prepublish":"yarn build"},"devDependencies":{"rimraf":"^2.6.2"},"dependencies":{"codesandbox-import-util-types":"^1.3.7","istextorbinary":"^2.2.1","lz-string":"^1.4.4"},"jest":{"transform":{".(ts|tsx)":"<rootDir>../../node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js"},"testEnvironment":"node","moduleFileExtensions":["ts","tsx","js","json"],"testPathIgnorePatterns":["<rootDir>/node_modules/","<rootDir>/dist/"],"testRegex":"(/__tests__/.*|\\.(test|spec))\\.(ts|tsx|js)$"},"gitHead":"f1b611e83cf5bec2223aeb85ad70e1d170689152","licenseText":"                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 CodeSandbox BV. <https://codesandbox.io/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\nLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n0.

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\nThe \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1.

Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2.  Conveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n\n3.  Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\n\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\n\n4.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version.
